# Animation Logger
An all-in-one game research tool! It loads all the animations that are currently playing!

Idea taken from Edge's Audio Logger.

**__When you click on a loaded animation, a panel will open with detailed information about it, for example: animation ID (can be copied), name, and basic playback functions__**

_P.S I would really appreciate it if the owner of Infinite Yield would add this to the list of admin commands!_
